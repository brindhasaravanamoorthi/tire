# Tire Condition Classifier using Deep Learning ðŸ›žðŸ§ 

This project uses Deep Learning to classify the condition of tires (e.g., new, worn-out, damaged) based on image input. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features and make predictions from tire images.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better training.
- **CNN Model**: Custom or pre-trained convolutional neural network for classification.
- **Training & Validation**: Trained on labeled tire image dataset with validation accuracy tracking.
- **Prediction**: Upload tire images and get condition predictions in real time.
- **Modular Code**: Separate files for data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack / Libraries

- **Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch  
- **Tools**: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended)
